Front-End aka UI -> User interface
-> Is what user sees and interacts with

Back-end:
-> Everything else other than the front end
-> All of the calculations, business logic goes into back end
-> The documents that are going to be displayed on the front-end are constructed/built in the back-end.

HTML -> Hypertext Markup Language

- H T M L
- It is a mark up language, not a programming language.
- Since it is not a programming language it does not have any programing logic such as loops or if conditions.
- HTML uses TAGS to create structure in the page.

CSS -> Cascading style sheets
- It is used to give style to EXISTING HTML structure.
- IF there is no HTML you cannot use CSS.

JAVASCRIPT -> JS
- It is used to give behavior on the existing HTML + CSS.

CAR - CARPET
APPLE - PINEAPPLE
EGG - EGGPLANT
JAVA - JAVASCRIPT

What is a web element?
-> Everything we see on a web page is a web element
ex: buttons, links, images etc.

What is a tag?
-> A tag is like a container in HTML page.
-> It allows us to give certain structure to the content in it.
-> We create a tag, and then we pass some information into that tag.
-> Then we are able to see the result of using that tag.

We have 2 types of tags:
-> #1 : paired tag:
- It has opening tag and closing tag.

syntax: <tagName> CONTENT GOES HERE </tagName>

-> #2 : unpaired tags : self-closing tag
- It does not have a closing tag, BECAUSE it is self-closing.

syntax: <tagName attributes go here>

HTML STRUCTURE:

-> DOCTYPE DECLARATION:
-> Tells our browser which version of the HTML we are using.
-> So that our browser knows what version and how to treat it.

-> HTML tag :
-> HTML Tag is the root/parent/ascendent of all of the other web elements on the page.
-> Which means everything else goes into HTML tag.

-> HEAD tag:
-> HEAD tag is where everything that is NOT displayed on the page is stored.
-> Such as titles, links, font styles etc.

-> BODY tag:
-> BODY tag is where all the content that is displayed on the page is stored.
-> Everything you see as a user is displayed here.

TAGS WE COVERED SO FAR
#1 -> TITLE TAG
- It is used to store the title of the page.

syntax: <title>Google</title>
--> "Google" text will be displayed on the tab inside of my browser.


#2 -> H tag - HEADERS

- Headers are used to create different types of headers.
- Starts from <h1> and goes upto <h6>
- The bigger the number, the smaller the text will be.
- h1 is used for main header
- h2 is used for sub-header



#3 -> P tag - PARAGRAPHS
- We use this tag to store some longer texts as paragraph

#4 -> LINE BREAK -> <br>
- Pushes everything that come after to the next line

#5 -> HORIZONTAL RULER -> <hr>
- Creates a single line that divides the page


#6 -> <strong> :
- Makes the text bolded
- strong is a paired tag

What is an attribute?
- Attributes provide additional information about the specific tag they are being passed in
- Attribute always goes into the opening tag
- We can pass more than one attribute inside of the opening tag

HOW TO CREATE LISTS IN HTML?
- There are two types of lists in HTML

#1 : Ordered List
- Ordered lists are basically just numbered lists.
- Ordered lists are created using <ol> : ol stands for ordered list
- Each list item is created using <li> : li stands for list item

#2 : Unordered List
- Unordered List are basically list items without numbers.
- Created using <ul> : stands for unordered list
- Each list item is created using <li> : li stands for list item
